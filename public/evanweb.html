            <div class="p1"><p> Now why is Roblox my favorite game? Roblox is a platform with a multitude of community made games for players, and it includes a wide variety of experiences, which are fun to play (atleast for some).
                You can also enjoy games with friends you can meet online or in real life. Also, you can customize your avatar in game with community made items with free and paid clothing, accessories, and a lot more. <br><br> </p>
            </div> <br> 
            <div class="p2"><p> This game is fun for me because it is one way to relieve stress by playing with friends and since Roblox is mostly community handled, your abilities and creativity are bound to your imagination.
                You can also find new people to talk and get to know to online which can expand your social group. There are an endless amount of games made and being made, so you may never get bored playing it.
